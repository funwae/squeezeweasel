# SqueezeWeasel Landing Page Specification

## Overall Feel

- **Dark terminal** background with **neon green** highlights and **red accents**.
- Feels like a trading command center crashed into a sci-fi console.
- The page reads like a story:
  *"Here's the problem. Here's what the Weasel hunts. Here's how you plug it in and get paid in clarity."*

## Page Sections

### 1. Hero

- Background:
  - Black → dark radial gradient.
  - Subtle animated green scan-line or grid (CSS-only if possible).
- Left:
  - Huge type:
    - "Let the Weasel Hunt the Squeezes."
  - Subheading:
    - "SqueezeWeasel scans Reddit sentiment and short-interest data to surface clean, explainable short-squeeze signals — before the crowd sees them."
  - CTA buttons:
    - Primary (green):
      - "Start My Radar"
    - Secondary (outline):
      - "See a Sample Briefing"
  - Microcopy:
    - "No hype, no financial advice. Just signals and receipts."
- Right:
  - Stylized "SqueezeWeasel Dashboard" mock:
    - Dark panel
    - Ranked tickers with SqueezeScore bars in neon green/red
    - Small sparkline charts

### 2. "Why This Exists" Problem Section

- Three columns on black:
  1. **Too many posts**
     - "Reddit, X, discords — millions of messages. You'll miss things."
  2. **Too much noise**
     - "Everything looks like a squeeze… until it doesn't."
  3. **Too expensive tools**
     - "Big-name scanners cost more per month than some accounts."
- Short paragraph:
  - "SqueezeWeasel is a focused radar: one job, done well."

### 3. "How SqueezeWeasel Hunts" Steps

- Horizontally laid timeline with neon-green connectors.

Steps:

1. **Scan the chatter**
   - "Weasel pulls posts and comments from your chosen subs, focused on tickers."
2. **Score the vibes**
   - "LLMs classify sentiment and squeeze language — not just mentions."
3. **Check the numbers**
   - "Short interest, float, and borrow stats for the most-talked-about tickers."
4. **Rank and brief**
   - "You wake up to a ranked watchlist and an at-a-glance brief."

Each step has:
- Icon in green outline on black circle.
- One-line explanation in white.

### 4. "What You Actually Get" – Deliverables

- Black cards with green borders:
  - Card 1: **Daily Squeeze Briefing**
    - "Your browser or inbox gets a single clean summary: the tickers, the scores, the reasons."
  - Card 2: **Backtests & Receipts**
    - "Run SqueezeWeasel on last month's data. See how early it would have flagged the movers."
  - Card 3: **Watchlist Mode**
    - "Focus the Weasel on your tickers. Get pinged when the pressure changes."

### 5. Comparison Section ("Compared to the Other Guys")

- 3-column comparison table:
  Columns: "Manual Scanning", "Legacy Scanners", "SqueezeWeasel"

Rows include:
- Setup time
- Monthly cost
- Explainability (Do you see why something is flagged?)
- Customizability (Can you change your own criteria?)
- MCP/AI Assistant integration

Use checkmarks and red "✖" icons. Keep SqueezeWeasel copy short and strong.

### 6. Pricing Teaser

Even if not final:
- Small panel:
  > "SqueezeWeasel is priced like a serious tool, not a luxury terminal.
  > Early users get founding-member pricing and direct input on features."
- CTA: "Get on the Early Access List"

### 7. FAQ + Disclaimer Footer

- Questions about:
  - Data sources
  - How often it runs
  - Backtesting
  - Safety and limitations
- Hard disclaimer block in small type with red accent line above:
  - "Nothing on this site or in this product is financial advice.
     SqueezeWeasel surfaces signals, not instructions. Trade at your own risk."

## Interactions & Animation

- Hover effects:
  - Neon-green glows around cards.
  - Small parallax on the hero dashboard mock.
- Scroll:
  - Subtle fade/slide-ins from bottom with short durations.
- No gaudy animations that interfere with legibility.

## SqueezeWeasel Logo Usage

- Place logo top-left in navbar:
  - Weasel icon + "SqueezeWeasel" wordmark.
- In hero, logo appears small; we let the **name and UI** do the heavy lifting.
- Avoid over-mascot-izing: no cartoon overload.
