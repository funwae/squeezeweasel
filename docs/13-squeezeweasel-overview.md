# SqueezeWeasel – Product Overview

## One-Line Positioning

> **SqueezeWeasel finds the short squeezes before the crowd and gives you clean, daily trading signals for a fraction of what "pro" tools charge.**

a **short-squeeze radar** wired into Reddit sentiment, short-interest data, and your own risk preferences.

It's routed through a **dark, neon-future interface** designed to feel like you're reading tomorrow's tape today.

## Key Differentiators

1. **Sentiment + Fundamentals**
   Not just chatter, not just short-interest numbers — SqueezeWeasel merges both.

2. **Explainable, Not Opaque**
   Every alert comes with:
   - Why it was surfaced
   - What the data looks like
   - How strong the squeeze signal is (SqueezeScore)

3. **Spec-Backed**
   Built on AgentFabric's spec-first engine:
   - Robust runs, logs, and backtests
   - No "black box" macros

4. **MCP-Native**
   Plugs into modern AI assistants:
   - "Hey, show me SqueezeWeasel's top 5 from this week" is a single MCP call.

## Core Flows

1. **Daily Radar Briefing**
   - You get a clean, single-screen rundown:
     - Top N squeeze candidates
     - Compact commentary
     - Links to drill-down pages

2. **Backtest Mode**
   - Run SqueezeWeasel on historical periods.
   - Visualize:
     - How early the alerts were
     - How often they were noise vs signal.

3. **Watchlist Mode**
   - Focus on tickers you care about.
   - Weasel tells you:
     - When sentiment spikes
     - When short-interest changes meaningfully.
