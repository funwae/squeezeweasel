# SqueezeWeasel Branding & Copy Guide

## Name

**SqueezeWeasel** – the name *is* the mascot.

- The brand voice uses the name as a character:
  - "SqueezeWeasel sniffed out 7 tickers overnight."
  - "Let the Weasel sleep on the charts so you don't have to."

---

## Tagline Options

1. **Primary**
   > *"SqueezeWeasel finds the squeezes and gives you clean signals for a fraction of what the terminals cost."*

2. **Short Versions**
   - "Let the Weasel hunt the squeezes."
   - "Signals, not noise. From a very fast weasel."

3. **Trader-Facing Hook**
   > "SqueezeWeasel watches Reddit while you sleep — and hands you a short-squeeze watchlist before the bell."

---

## Tone & Style

- **Dark-terminal + neon finance**:
  - Futuristic, but readable and calm.
- **Smart, not meme-y**:
  - Light touches of humor, but everything still feels professional.
- **Direct**:
  - Clear promises, explicit limitations, no magic claims.

## Core Value Propositions (Copy Skeletons)

### 1. Time

> **"You only have so many screens and so many hours."**
> SqueezeWeasel does the boring part for you:
> - Scanning subs
> - Counting mentions
> - Tracking short interest
> So your brain is free for one job: **trade well.**

### 2. Signal Quality

> "Anyone can give you 200 tickers a day.
> SqueezeWeasel gives you **five that actually make sense** — and shows you why."

### 3. Price vs Legacy Tools

> "You don't need Bloomberg.
> You need **credible squeeze alerts** that don't break your P/L in subscription fees."

Template:

> **SqueezeWeasel finds** <target opportunity>
> **and gives you** <deliverable>
> **for** <cost/complexity advantage> **compared to** <alternatives>.

Examples:

- "SqueezeWeasel finds **quietly building short squeezes** and gives you **a ranked, annotated watchlist** for **less than you'd spend on one impulsive trade** compared to big-terminal scanners."
- "SqueezeWeasel finds **the three tickers your Discord will be screaming about tomorrow** and gives you **a calm, data-backed breakdown** for **pennies on the dollar** compared to quant tools."

## Key Sections – Copy Moodboards

### Hero Heading

- "Let the Weasel Hunt the Squeezes."
- Subheading:
  > "A neon-future radar for short-squeeze opportunities.
  > Built on AgentFabric, designed for real traders, priced like a tool not a tax."

### Social Proof Block

Smaller text:

> "Designed with active traders.
> Built on a spec-first automation engine.
> Logs, backtests, and receipts for every alert."

### How It Works (Three Steps)

1. "**Tell SqueezeWeasel your hunting grounds.**
   Choose subs, time windows, and your risk preferences."

2. "**Connect a couple of keys.**
   Reddit, data provider, and your alert channels."

3. "**Wake up to a short-squeeze radar.**
   A clean list of candidates with data and context, not hype."

## Microcopy & UI Language

- Buttons:
  - "Run Tonight's Hunt"
  - "Show Me Today's Squeezes"
  - "Backtest This Setup"
- Alerts:
  - "Weasel found 6 tickers that match your squeeze criteria."
  - "No credible squeezes today — and that's a good thing."

---

## Disclaimers (Tone)

- Always present near CTAs and data charts:
  - "SqueezeWeasel does not provide financial advice.
    It surfaces signals and summaries based on your configuration. You are responsible for your trades."
